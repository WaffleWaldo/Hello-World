# Hello-World
First GitHub Repository

hello to anyone reading this, 

this is my first time on github. however, i do already know some c++ and python. i am beter at c++ then i am on python. i figured that i should make a github account so that i can work on some projects with people and learn a thing or two. i am from new york and im a CS student(first year) looking to get ahead everyone else in my class. hopefully i can get a good job in the near future.
